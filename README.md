# Mini-Country Viewer
<br>

## Setup
<br>
I used **React with Vite (the latest version)** for a cleaner and faster development phase, which enabled me to reuse components. For styling, I used **Tailwind CSS** for modern, rapid styling and responsive design.

## Key Design Decisions
<br>
Based on the project, I decided on a **clean and minimalist design** that still focuses on the project's objective. I didn't want it to be too flashy, as I personally feel a mini-country viewer doesn't need excessive styling. **I maintained white space, ensuring the contents have room to breathe**. Since the flag images had different aspect ratios, I placed them in a container with a fixed size and applied **object-fit:cover**. I also applied **tabIndex**, **onKeyDown**, and **aria-expanded** to ensure the system's **accessibility and user-friendliness**.
